# Vue 3 + Vuetify CVOCA Website Rules

You are an expert in Vue 3, Vuetify 3, Vue Router, Pinia, and modern web development.

## Core Principles
- Write simple, readable, optimized code
- Prioritize clarity over complexity
- Use early returns and avoid nested conditions
- Follow DRY principles

## Vue 3 Guidelines
- Always use `<script setup>` syntax
- Use Composition API with ref/reactive
- Leverage auto-imports (no need to import ref, computed, etc.)
- Define props with types: `defineProps({ title: String })`
- Use `defineEmits()` for component events

## Code Style
- Use descriptive names: `isLoading`, `hasError`
- Write short functions with single purpose
- Prefer arrow functions for methods
- Use template syntax for declarative rendering

## Material You 3 Design
- Use Material You 3 principles for modern, beautiful UI
- Implement dynamic color theming with Vuetify's theme system
- Use large, rounded corners: `rounded-xl`, `rounded-lg`
- Apply elevation and shadows: `elevation-2`, `elevation-4`
- Use proper color tokens: `surface`, `primary`, `secondary`
- Implement smooth transitions and micro-animations
- Follow Material You 3 motion principles for natural feel

## Color & Theming
- Create cohesive color schemes with primary/secondary/tertiary colors
- Use surface variants for depth and hierarchy
- Implement proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Support both light and dark themes seamlessly
- Use color to convey meaning and brand identity

## Vuetify Specific
- Use Vuetify 3 components with Material You styling
- Leverage modern variants: `v-btn variant="elevated"`, `v-card variant="outlined"`
- Use adaptive layouts with `v-container`, `v-row`, `v-col`
- Apply consistent spacing: `ma-4`, `pa-6`, `mx-auto`
- Use Vuetify's color system: `color="primary"`, `bg-color="surface"`

## Project Structure
- Import data from `/src/data/*.json`
- Store shared state in Pinia stores
- Reference images: `/assets/images/filename.jpg`
- Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for files

## Performance & UX
- Use `v-show` for frequent toggles
- Use `v-if` for conditional rendering
- Implement lazy loading for large lists
- Add loading skeletons and smooth state transitions
- Ensure 60fps animations and micro-interactions
- Minimize watchers and computed dependencies

## Modern Visual Design
- Use bold, expressive typography with Vuetify's text classes
- Implement hero sections with large headings and engaging visuals
- Apply consistent visual hierarchy with proper heading scales
- Use whitespace generously for clean, breathable layouts
- Add subtle animations and hover effects for interactivity
- Implement Material You 3 card designs with proper elevation
- Use progressive disclosure and layered information architecture
- Use professional color palettes that convey trust and authority
- Create engaging call-to-action buttons with proper emphasis
- Maintain professional aesthetics suitable for chartered accountants
- Balance modern design with corporate credibility

## Best Practices
- Handle loading and error states with elegant transitions
- Include accessibility attributes and ARIA labels
- Use responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Create visually engaging components with proper contrast
- Implement dark/light theme switching seamlessly
- Write complete, working code with no TODOs
